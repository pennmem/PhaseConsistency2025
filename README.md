# Abstract

Human and animal studies implicate theta and alpha oscillations in memory
function.  We tested whether theta, alpha, and beta phase consistency predicts
memory encoding dynamics in neurosurgical patients performing delayed free
recall tasks with either unrelated (N=188) or categorized words (N=157).
Post-stimulus oscillatory phase consistency occurred at 3-21Hz across
widespread brain regions.  Greater recall of early-list items correlated
significantly with increased theta (3-7Hz) phase consistency.  Controlling for
serial position effects, subsequently recalled versus forgotten items showed
distinct frequency-dependent phase consistency: theta (3-6Hz) and alpha
(9-14Hz) for unrelated lists, and primarily theta (3-6Hz) and beta (14-19Hz)
for categorized lists.  Early-list items showed significant theta phase
consistency differences, while later items showed alpha differences in
unrelated word lists and both theta and beta differences in categorized word
lists.  The lateral temporal cortex showed significant theta effects, and the
prefrontal cortex exhibited both theta and alpha differences.  These findings
show that with effects across multiple frequency bands, oscillatory phase
exhibits more consistent alignment with stimuli onset during stronger
episodic encoding.
