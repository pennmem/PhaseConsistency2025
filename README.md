# Abstract

Human and animal studies implicate theta and alpha oscillations in memory
function.  We tested whether theta, alpha, and beta phase consistency predicts
memory encoding dynamics in neurosurgical patients performing delayed free
recall tasks with either unrelated (N=188) or categorized words (N=157).  We
observed widespread post-stimulus phase consistency (3-21 Hz) and, crucially,
identified distinct frequency-specific patterns predictive of successful
encoding.  Specifically, increased early-list item recall was significantly
correlated across subjects with increased theta (3-7 Hz) phase consistency.
Subsequent recall analyses, controlling for serial position, revealed distinct
frequency signatures for successfully encoded items: theta (3-6 Hz) and alpha
(9-14 Hz) for unrelated lists, and theta (3-6 Hz) and beta (14-19 Hz) for
categorized lists.  Regional analyses for unrelated lists highlighted the
lateral temporal cortex for theta effects and the prefrontal cortex for both
theta and alpha consistency.  These findings provide novel evidence for the
frequency-specific presence of increased phase consistency during episodic
encoding, revealing its sensitivity to both item context and temporal position
within a learning sequence.
